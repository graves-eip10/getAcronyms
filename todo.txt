The program currently saves to a set filename. I'd like to prompt the user for a filename instead.

This program gets the acronyms from a single file. I want to create a stronger program that gets all the files from all the docx files in a filepath.

Does the current method of saving all text to a single string present issues with very large files? Python is a 32-bit file for most users, so it can only handle ~4.3 GB.
